## Welcome to Suriya's Portfolio

I am Suriya, a master's student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am extremely passionate about computer graphics and am learning and exploring this wonderful field. I am interested in lighting and rendering while exploring other aspects of appearance modeling and real-time rendering. This exploration has taught me a lot and I have put together some of the projects. Please feel free to share feedback on my work.
