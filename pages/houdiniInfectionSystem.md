# Houdini Infection Systems

This work shares my Houdini learning experience - Pyro Solver, MaterialX, and Karma.

[Inspired by Armin Lotfi Tutorial](https://www.behance.net/armin_lotfi)

1. Pyro Solver - Using the pyro solver to select particles to spread infection
2. MaterialX - All the materials were set using MaterialX - diffuse, metallic, emission
3. Karma - Rendering done completely in Solaris with Karma
