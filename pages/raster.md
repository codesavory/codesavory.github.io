## Rasterization Project

This page is going to track the progress on the rasterization renderer built from scratch. Please wait for updates, code and results.

### Milestones
1. Getting the basic renderer running - edge function and 2D triangle rendered.
2. Updating to complex scene using z-buffer and shading.
